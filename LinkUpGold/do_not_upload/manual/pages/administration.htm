<p>You can have an unlimited number of administrators. 
Each administrator can have different permissions. There is even the option 
to have administrators who can edit links, articles, blogs, videos and news  in some categories only. 
To create such admin check the following field(s) in the Administrators edit 
form:<br>- Add/view/edit/delete links<br>- Add/view/edit/delete articles<br>- Add/view/edit/delete videos<br>- Add/view/edit/delete news<br>- Add/view/edit/delete blogs<br>Uncheck 
the following field(s):<br>- Add/view/edit/delete links of all categories, can import links<br>- 
Add/view/edit/delete articles of all categories&nbsp;<br>- 
Add/view/edit/delete videos of all categories&nbsp;<br>- 
Add/view/edit/delete news of all categories&nbsp;<br>- 
Add/view/edit/delete blogs of all categories&nbsp;<br>Then you receive another 
table with a list of categories. There you can choose the categories where the 
administrator can edit links/articles/blogs/videos/news.</p>
<p>The login system for administrators 
uses sessions and cookies. It means each administrators must have enabled cookies 
to log in.</p>
<p>Be very careful if you want to give someone 
the permission to edit administrators. This person will be able to edit also own 
account and grab as many permissions as he/she wants.</p>
