<p><span class="text13a_bold">How it works</span><br /><br />Most of the public 
pages is generated on-the-fly, the data 
 is always fresh.  Only your home page (index.php) and some parts of other pages are saved 
to static files, these files need to be created once a day. <a href="rebuild.htm">Click 
here</a> to read a detailed info.<br /></p>
<p><b><u>Styles</u></b></p>
<p>There 
are several styles available by default, each style has its own subdirectory in directory 
&quot;styles&quot;. Each of these subdirectories contains a styles.css 
file where are defined all colors and fonts for  that style. Each style also 
contains  images, these are used for backgrounds of tables and pages. You 
can freely edit the styles.css files as well as images, you also 
can edit templates of each style or create your own style(s).</p>
<p>If you have a template and don't know how to use it in Link Up Gold, we can 
create a new style for you by using your own template.<br /><br /><b><u>Templates</u></b></p>
<p>All public 
pages are based on templates - these are normal HTML&nbsp;or text files  
editable in your favorite HTML or text editor. If possible, we recommend to use 
a plain text editor (Notepad, Crimson Editor, NoteTab, First Page 2000, HTML-Kit 
and so on)&nbsp;because WYSIWYG editors (like FrontPage, DreamWeaver etc.) often 
add unwanted tags or remove necessary items, this may cause an error. However if you&nbsp;use a WYSIWYG editor, make sure that&nbsp;your 
editor don't modify hidden fields of forms. Also note that the original templates 
are not complete HTML pages - the header and footer are included automatically 
by scripts (take a look&nbsp;below for more info) so if your editor adds 
header and footer tags (&lt;html&gt;&lt;header&gt; .... &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;) 
to your templates, the finished pages will have these tags two times.<br /><br />Most of  the 
templates contain 
special 
tags which look like #%someword%#. Scripts replace these tags with some values (like 
Link Title, Description,  numbers of clicks etc.). Templates can be found 
in directory styles/STYLE_NAME/templates. Styles which don't have 
their own templates or have only a few of them&nbsp;use &quot;common&quot; 
templates, these are stored in folder _common. In other words, 
when the script needs to create a page, it searches for the required template 
in the folder of the style which is just selected. If the required template 
is missing in this folder, it grabs it in folder _common.<br />Templates 
with <span class="template">html</span> extension are always used to create complete 
HTML pages. Templates with <span class="template">txt</span> extension are used for fragments 
of HTML pages (for example for a single link which should be repeated multiple 
times on a  page).<br /><br /><b><u>HTML 
Templates</u></b><br /></p>
<p>At the top of each public page there is automatically 
added content of the template<span class="template"> _head1.txt</span>. 
At the end of each public page is automatically added content of file<span class="template"> _footer.txt</span>. 
You can use these files 
to add some content to each public page. It may save you a lot of time when you 
will need to change something on all pages. By default, the&nbsp;_head1.txt 
is used to insert the first tags of each page.<br />In the &quot;templates&quot; directory is also one&nbsp;file which may be optionally inserted into each public page 
- <span class="template">_head2.txt</span>. This file is by default used to show the header table 
and menu which is shared by all pages. It means that if you want to&nbsp;add your logo 
or something else to each page, this is the file to edit. Content of this file 
is not inserted automatically. It can be used in html templates. Use variable 
#%head%# 
to display this content.</p>
<p>There are also files whose 
content may be inserted into any public page to any place you want.&nbsp;Names 
of these files look like <span class="template">_inX.txt</span> where X is a 
numeric value. You can change the amount of these files in configuration. The 
default value is 2. If you need more, create new files in the templates directory 
and enter the maximum allowed number of them in configuration. Since it may 
cause too high server load to use many of these files, we recommend to never 
use more than 10-15. If you want to insert a content of one of these files to any 
of your pages,  write #%inX%# to any template HTML to the 
place where should be displayed this content. For example the variable #%in2%# 
shows the content of file _in2.txt. By default are these files used only  for the tables on the left and  right side of 
each page and for the search box at the top.  
In all these files _inX.txt may be&nbsp;used some&nbsp;variables which are automatically replaced with their 
values. These variables are:<br /></p>

<br />There are also some special variables which 
look like #_variable_#. Please don't edit these variables, these are usually 
used to show or hide a content of a page, depending on the current configuration 
and needs. These variables are needed for the system to work.<p><u><b>Email 
templates</b></u><br />All email templates may 
be found in <b>styles/_common/email_templates</b> 
directory. If you need different email 
templates for individual styles (for example to create&nbsp;a multi-language directory), 
copy the directory email_templates to&nbsp;directory of the&nbsp;style(s) where you want to 
use it. The system is the same as for templates for pages - the script searches 
for a template in directory of the selected style, if the required template 
does not exist, it grabs it from the _common directory. Note that 
different styles are not applicable to all email templates. The script can apply 
different styles to those email templates which are used to send emails from 
public pages (like link_added.txt, tell_friend.txt), it applies the currently 
selected style. Different styles are not supported for email templates sent 
by admin (for example link_approved.txt, newsletter.txt) because there is not 
a style selected in the time when the email is sent.<br /> 
The first line of each email template must always begin with the word &quot;Subject: &quot; and below this line 
must be one blank line, then is a text of the email.<br />In configuration, there 
is the option to choose to send all emails in HTML or plain text format. You 
also can send only selected emails in HTML format. To do it, enter &quot;HTML_EMAIL&quot; 
(without quotes) at the end of subject line of the selected template.<br /><br /></p>
<p><b><u>Messages</u></b><br />Messages generated by scripts are used when the 
system needs to show some info to visitors. It may be for example 
error messages in the link submit form in the case that the entered data was 
rejected etc. The system is the same as for templates - you can have different 
messages for each style. By default, messages for style &quot;_common&quot; 
are used for all styles.</p>
<p><b><u>CSS Styles</u></b></p>
<p>Each of the color styles contains a styles.css file in its subfolder in styles 
directory. In this file are editable all colors, fonts and all other features 
of the color style. There also can be enabled/disabled the left and right columns. 
For example the left column is defined by using this code:</p>
<p><span class="fakelink">.left_column {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display:block;<br>}</span></p>
<p>You can edit it like this to hide the left column:</p>
<p><span class="fakelink">.left_column {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display:none;<br>}</span></p>
