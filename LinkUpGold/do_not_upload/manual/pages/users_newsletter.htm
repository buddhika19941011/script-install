<p><span class="text13a_bold">Newsletters</span><br /></p>
<p>Newsletters can be sent in admin area and you also can creare crontab commands 
to send them. The command should look exactly like the command 
which runs <a href="rebuild.htm">daily job</a>, only add this to the end of 
the URL in the command:</p>
<p><span class="fakelink">&amp;newsletter=NEWSLETTER_NUMBER&amp;days=7</span></p>
<p>Instead of CATEGORY_NUMBER use real newsletter number (1-5), instead of 7 
can be used any other value, it will include to the newsletter content which 
has been added in the last X days (in this example in the last 7 days).</p>
<p>The script use 2 templates 
to send the newsletter:<br /><span class="template">newsletter.txt</span> 
- this is the body of the email. In 
this template may be used these variables:<br />#%name%# for name of the user<br />#%links%# 
&nbsp;&nbsp;it will be replaced by links added in the last X days<br>#%articles%# 
&nbsp;&nbsp;it will be replaced by links added in the last X days<br />#%unsubscribe%# 
&nbsp;&nbsp;it will be replaced by a link where the user can unsubscribe</p>
<p><span class="template">newsletter_item.txt</span> 
- each item in the email will be based on this template. You can use these variables:<br />#%title%# 
&nbsp;&nbsp;Title of the item (link, article, video, news item)<br />#%url%# &nbsp;URL of the link<br />#%description%# 
&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of the item<br />#%created%# &nbsp;&nbsp;Date created<br /></p>
