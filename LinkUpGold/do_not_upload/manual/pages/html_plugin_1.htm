<p>HTML Plugin is an optional addon for Link Up Gold. It can be ordered  in our <a href="http://www.phpwebscripts.com/scripts/owner.php" target="_blank">users 
area</a>. This plugin has two main options. You can switch between them 
in Configuration - at the end of the form there is HTML Plugin section. These 
options are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li><u>Static HTML Pages</u> If this option is enabled, your home page, 
    all categories and optionally link and article detail pages are static. 
    The URL's are search engines friendly and it also saves server resources 
    because it doesn't have to read the database each time when someone browses 
    your site. However there are also some disadvantages. <a href="html_plugin_2.htm">More 
    ...</a></li>
    <li><u>Rewrite option</u> All pages are dynamic but the system uses Apache 
    Rewrite module to create nice URL's. <a href="html_plugin_3.htm">More ...</a></li>
</ul>
