<p><span class="text13a_bold">HTML Plugin - static HTML pages</span><br /><p>If this option 
is used, the plugin saves most public pages to static HTML files. It can be useful if you have a high 
traffic site - PHP scripts need more server resources than static HTML files. 
By using this option,  your 
pages are displayed faster. </p>
<p>The following pages become static:<br /></p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Your home page.</li>
    <li>All categories. Names of the files are by default 
    created from names of categories. You also can set names of files of a selected 
    category manually in the category edit form - there is the field &quot;Name of static html page&quot;.<br></li>
    <li>It can optionally create a page for each individual link and article. The 
    names of files are automatically created from the titles of the items. You 
    also can manually enter file names in the link and article edit forms - 
    there is the field &quot;Rewrite URL&quot; for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Configuration there are a few fields that need to be filled in if you 
want to use this option. The required fields are these:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Extension of created static pages.</li>
    <li>Name of your home page.</li>
    <li>Folders to store pages (each of these fields should have an unique value).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use this option, there are some limitations 
because your pages are static and can't respond immediately to all actions of 
your visitors. Below is a list of these limits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If someone clicks on a link, article, blog, video or news item the number of clicks/reads will 
    not increase immediately but after the next daily rebuild.</li>
    <li>If 
PHP on your server is running in a &quot;safe mode&quot;, you can't 
use this feature because the script needs some time (several minutes)&nbsp;when 
rebuilding pages and in &quot;safe mode&quot; the server doesn't allow it.</li>
    <li>You can't use the automatic rebuild function. 
    Set a Crontab or Task Manager job to rebuild your pages or do it manually in the Administration.</li>
    <li>You can't use the &quot;Select style&quot; feature 
    which allows users to select the style they like, only one style can be 
    used. </li>
    <li>CSS styles are taken from the style you selected in 
    Configuration but all templates and messages are always taken from directory 
    &quot;_common&quot;.</li>
    <li>The field &quot;Use Ajax to load individual pages in categories&quot; 
    must be checked.</li>
    <li>You can't sell impressions for advertising 
    links as the pages are static so the script can't detect each impression. 
    For this reason you can't sell them and also users can't see them in statistics. 
    However you can still sell clicks or days.</li>
    <li>New RSS content can be available after the&nbsp;daily rebuild only.</li>
    <li>The front page with a header and search form only is not available.<br />&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
Follow these steps to enable the option to create static pages:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Check field &quot;<span class=text13>Build static html files&quot; 
    in Configuration.</span></li>
    <li>Enter values to all the required fields (see above).</li>
    <li>Set permission of your home directory 
    to 777</li>
    <li>If you set to create  category pages and detail pages in another directories, create 
    these directories and chmod them to 
    777.</li>
    <li>If you want to use Crontab or Task Manager 
    to rebuild your pages, set the Daily  job as described <a href="rebuild.htm">here</a>. 
    Note that you can't use the automatic rebuild feature but you 
    still can rebuild your pages manually in any time&nbsp;in the Administration.<br /></li>
    <li>If you set to create a static page for each individual article, enter 
    the following HTML code to template article_details.html. It lets you track 
    number of reads, even when this page is static:<span class="fakelink"><br>&lt;img 
    border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;#%site_url%#/article.php?n=#%n%#&amp;track_hit=1&quot;&gt;</span></li>
    <li>If you set to create a static page for each individual video, enter 
    the following HTML code to template video_details.html. It lets you track 
    number of views, even when this page is static: <span class="fakelink"><br>&lt;img 
    border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;#%site_url%#/video.php?n=#%n%#&amp;track_hit=1&quot;&gt;</span></li>
    <li>If you set to create a static page for each individual news item, enter 
    the following HTML code to template new_details.html. It lets you track 
    number of reads, even when this page is static:<span class="fakelink"><br>&lt;img 
    border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;#%site_url%#/new.php?n=#%n%#&amp;track_hit=1&quot;&gt;&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li>If you set to create a static page for each individual blog, enter 
    the following HTML code to template blog_details.html. It lets you track 
    number of reads, even when this page is static:<span class="fakelink"><br>&lt;img 
    border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;#%site_url%#/blog.php?n=#%n%#&amp;track_hit=1&quot;&gt;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</li>
    <li> Use function Reset/rebuild =&gt; Daily job in 
the Administration to rebuild pages, then check if all works well.</li>
    <li>Delete this code in the template index.html:<br><span class="fakelink">&lt;a 
    href=&quot;javascript:hide_home();show_home('2');show_home('3');show_home('4');show_home('5');show_home('6');&quot;&gt;All 
    categories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:hide_home();show_home('7');show_home('8');show_home('9');show_home('10');show_home('11');show_home('12');&quot;&gt;Recently 
    added&lt;/a&gt; :</span>: &nbsp;</li>
