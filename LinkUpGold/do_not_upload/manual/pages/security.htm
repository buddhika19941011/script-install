                    <p><b><span class="text13a_bold">Security Tips</span></b><br /><br />Please 
follow as many of the following security tips as possible. Note that if a hacker 
enters your Administration, he/she will be able to damage all your content and configuration.
<p>Delete setup.php immediately after you installed the script. If you lost 
your admin password and you used script create_admin.php to create a new administrator, 
immediately delete this script from your server after you used it.</p>
<p>Use strong login data. Do not use normal words as your login data to Administration 
but use something like almsdd5d1svd2s8/oysnc2s5h3da6hq. Your&nbsp;username 
as well as password can be up to 15 characters long, use all these characters.</p>
<p>If your server allows it, protect your administration directory by .htaccess/.htpasswd 
files.</p>
<p>Use the configuration option which allows you to set a maximum allowed number 
of failed login attempts from the same IP address.</p>
<p>If you don't plan to edit configuration, chmod file data/data.php to 644. 
If you don't plan to edit templates, chmod all files in templates, email_templates 
and messages directories 
to 644, also chmod these directories to 755.</p>
