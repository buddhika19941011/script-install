<p><span class="text13a_bold">Configuration</span><br /><br /><u>MySql 
database data</u> - Enter data of your database. 
If you don't have a database, ask your server admin to create one for you. If 
you are not sure about '<span class=text1>Mysql database host' 
try enter 'localhost'.<br />Prefix 
of all tables - you can set 1-3 letters 
which will be at begin of titles of all tables used by Link Up Gold. It may 
be useful if you want to install the script more than once and use the same 
database. Please never change this value when then script is already installed.</span><br /><u>Secret 
word</u> - it is a &quot;password&quot; for your script 
rebuild.php. This is because the script is available for&nbsp;public so it 
checks if the password corresponds every time when it's called. If the password 
is wrong or missing, the script do nothing. If you take this field blank, the 
script will not require password (not recommended).<br /><u>Send 
emails in HTML format</u> - If 
this is selected, all emails generated by scripts get a HTML header. It doesn't affect emails which are sent by 
admin - for example newsletter. Emails in HTML format may be useful if your 
language uses some characters which are not shown correctly in text emails. 
To use this feature you must fill in the field below also (&quot;<span class=text13>Which charset should we use in HTML emails?&quot;). 
<i>Note: Most versions of PHP running on Windows servers does not support HTML 
emails.<br /></i></span>You 
also can send only selected emails in HTML format. To do it, enter &quot;HTML_EMAIL&quot; 
(without quotes) at the end of subject line of the selected template.<br />&nbsp;</p>
