<p>Maps which are provided by Google can be used in categories and also on detail pages. This feature 
may be useful for example to create a business directory which can show each 
business in a map. In each category is the option to enter a mail address or 
coordinates (latitude and longitude). If you entered some of these values, it 
automatically shows the map on pages of the selected category. It's also possible 
to enter a mail address in each link, article, video, blog and news item. Items 
which contain a real mail address are displayed on the map in the category where 
are listed and also on their detail pages is displayed a map which shows their 
location.</p>
