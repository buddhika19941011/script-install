<p>1) Extract the zip which contains Link Up Gold. It 
creates a folder, feel free to rename it. </p>
<p>2) Upload all files on your server into the correct directories. Upload all the files but images in ASCII mode. <u>Do not upload folder 
&quot;do_not_upload&quot;.</u><br /><br />3) <b>Set permissions</b> for directories and files.<br>This 
step is needed on some servers only. You can skip it and follow with step #4. 
If you will receive a permission error, follow also this step #3.<br /></p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>These 
files and directories need permission <b>777</b>:<br>- data directory<br />- messages directory 
(it's inside &quot;styles/_common&quot; directory)<br />- 
email_templates directory (it's inside &quot;styles/_common&quot; directory)<br>- 
templates directory (it's inside &quot;styles/_common&quot; directory and also 
    inside some other subdirectories of the styles directory)<br />- images/articles directory<br />- images/categories directory<br />- images/links directory<br />- images/news directory<br />- images/users directory<br />- images/videos directory<br>- images/blogs directory<br>- 
    uploads/qrcodes folder<br />- 
    files sitemap.txt, sitemap.html and sitemap.xml in main directory</li>
    <li>These files need permission 
<b>666</b>:<br />- file &quot;data_forms.php&quot; in data directory<br />- all files in the &quot;messages&quot; directory 

(it's inside &quot;styles/_common&quot; directory)<br />- 
all files in &quot;email_templates&quot; directory 
(it's inside &quot;styles/_common&quot; directory)<br />- 
all files in &quot;templates&quot; directories (it's inside &quot;styles/_common&quot; directory 
    and also inside some other subdirectories of the styles directory)</li>
    <li>These directories need permission <b>755</b> (it usually doesn't need 
    any change, servers usually set it automatically):<br />- directory where your 
    scripts and other directories reside<br />- 
administration directory<br />- images directory</li>
</ul>
<p>4) Point your browser to your domain to file <span class="fakelink">setup.php</span>. Now fill 
in all required fields and click to the Install  button. You should see that the 
script creates tables and files for Link Up Gold. </p>
<p>5) Once the script has been successfully installed, go to administration 
and follow these steps:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Remove setup.php from your server.</li>
    <li>Main configuration - enter values to all fields. Save the form.</li>
    <li>Reset/rebuild - run Daily Job. It builds all pages. If you receive an&nbsp;error 
    during this step, there is some missing value in Configuration.</li>
    <li>Add a few categories to test if all works well. To 
    make these items visible on the home page and in the left and right columns 
    of all pages, run the Daily Job again.</li>
    <li>Set the script up to run Daily Job. Read more about this issue <a href="rebuild.htm">here</a>.</li>
    <li>You also can customize templates. More info here <a href="howitworks.htm">here</a>.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</li>
