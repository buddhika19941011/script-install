<p><span class="text13a_bold">Incoming clicks - click.php</span><br /><br />This 
script counts incoming clicks for each link and then sends the visitor to your 
home page  or to the category where the link comes from - both these options 
are in  Configuration. If you want to count  incoming clicks  
      you have to ask link owners to send clicks to <span class="fakelink">click.php?n=LINK_NUMBER</span> 
      where LINK_NUMBER is an actual number of a link.<br />Then you can 
set that links should be sorted by incoming clicks so links sending more clicks 
will be higher up on your pages.<br />Note: Link owners also can use your search 
box and each searching they send will be counted as one hit sent to you. More 
info <a href="search.htm">here</a>.<br /><br /><br /></p>
