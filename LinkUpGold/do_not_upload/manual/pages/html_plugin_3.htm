<p><span class="text13a_bold">HTML Plugin -  Apache Rewrite Module</span></p>
<p>All the pages are dynamic, all the common features can be used as before. 
This option creates nice / search engine friendly URL's. Example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>URL of your home page is <span class="fakelink">http://www.yourdomain.com/index.html</span> 
    instead of <span class="fakelink">http://www.yourdomain.com/index.php</span>.</li>
    <li>URL's of categories look like <span class="fakelink">http://www.yourdomain.com/directory-articles/category-name/</span></li>
    <li>URL's for individual links/articles/news/videos look like <span class="fakelink">http://www.yourdomain.com/directory-link-ITEM_NUMBER/link-title.html</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To enabled this option check the field &quot;Use Apache Rewrite module&quot; 
in Configuration. Also enter values to these fields (each of them should have 
an unique value):</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Virtual folders to store pages</li>
    <li>Extension of links/articles/videos/news detail pages</li>
</ul>
<p>This option needs to have&nbsp;Rewrite 
Module enabled/allowed&nbsp;in Apache configuration. It also needs you&nbsp;to create a text file in Link Up Gold main directory. 
    Name of this file will be &quot;.htaccess&quot;. Note that name of this 
    file has a dot at the begin. The commands for this line will be generated 
automatically in  Configuration, at the bottom of the form. Copy these commands 
to your .htaccess file. On the end of this file must be one blank line.</p>
<p>When you use this option, use only classic links to link to previous/next pages. 
Do not use the drop-down menu option.</p>
