<p>Nearly all pages 
of the whole system are generated on-the-fly 
but your home page -&nbsp;index.php. Also some parts of other pages are not generated 
on-the-fly but are&nbsp;saved to files. These parts are: _in1.txt, _in2.txt, 
optionally other _inX.txt files if you use them. It's required to create these files once a day.  It works so 

because these files contain static data which are valid&nbsp;for a long time 
so it's useless to load them from database each time when someone reaches 
your site.</p>
<p>There are 3 different ways to run this job:<br><b>Automatically</b> 
- Check field &quot;Run the regular jobs 
automatically&quot; in your Configuration. This is a very easy way but it needs additional 
system resources and it is not recommended.<br><b>By using Crontab (Linux) or Task Manager 
(Windows)</b> - it's the best way but there is needed a little more setting. 
You can read below how to set a Crontab job on your server. If you use 
this way, never check the field &quot;Run 
the daily  job 
automatically&quot; in the Configuration.<br><b>Manually</b> - You can run this 
job manually in the Administration. Note that if you run it in other time than after 
midnight, it can damage the daily and monthly statistic.<br><br><b><u>Using Crontab</u><br><BR></b>If you didn't 
use Crontab before, please go to <A 
href="http://webmasterworkshop.com/guides/crontab_guide.shtml">http://webmasterworkshop.com/guides/crontab_guide.shtml</A>  
to a simple info about it.</p>
<P>If you set up in your Configuration that time on the server is different from 
a real time, you must move also the Daily Job. For example if there is +2 hours 
difference, you have to run the Daily Job after 2 am.</P>
<p>Examples of possible Crontab commands are available in Administration =&gt;
