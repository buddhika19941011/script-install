<p><span class="text13a_bold">Videos</span><br /><br />Videos can be imported 
from Youtube. Your directory can receive&nbsp;new videos&nbsp;many times a day 
without any effort. In the category edit forms you can set how often it should 
import videos&nbsp;to each of your categories. It's also possible to use a crontab 
command to run these imports. The command should look exactly like the command 
which runs <a href="rebuild.htm">daily job</a>, only add this to the end of 
the URL in the command:</p>
<p><span class="fakelink">&amp;action=import_youtube&amp;c=CATEGORY_NUMBER</span></p>
<p>Instead of CATEGORY_NUMBER use real number of the category where it should 
import videos. Each category should have its own crontab command.</p>
