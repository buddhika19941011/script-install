<p>Thank you very much for purchasing Link Up Gold. We hope that you will be happy with&nbsp;the script. If you have any questions 
or suggestions, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:info@phpwebscripts.com">email&nbsp;us</a>.<br /><br />Thank 
you<br />PHPWebScripts Team<br /><br /><br /><br /><span class="text13a_bold">Link Up Gold - Introduction</span><br /><br />Link Up Gold
 is an advanced script for running your own web directory. 
It supports an unlimited number of categories in an unlimited number of levels. Most 
pages is generated online, the data are always fresh. There are 5 main groups 
of content: links, articles, blogs, news from RSS sources and videos from youtube.com.<br /><br />All 
public pages are based on templates, this feature allows you to edit them, remove 
unwanted features etc. Templates are normal HTML&nbsp;or text files 
and can be edited in your favorite HTML or text editor. These templates contain 
special tags (variables) which look like #%someword%#. These tags are replaced by some 
values (link Link Title, Description, any numbers and so on). In this Manual 
you can find a detailed description of each template. <br /><br />If you don't want to generate pages on-the-fly but 
save them as common&nbsp;HTML files (it may be useful if you have a high traffic 
site, php scripts need more server resources than html files), you will need 
a special plugin which may be purchased extra in our <a href="http://www.phpwebscripts.com/scripts/owner.php" target="_blank">owner's 
area</a>. This plugin also has another&nbsp;option - not to create static pages 
but use Apache Rewrite module. In this case all pages stay dynamic but your URL's 
will look like they were. More info regarding this plugin 
may be found <a href="html_plugin_1.htm" target="detail">here</a>.<br /></p>
