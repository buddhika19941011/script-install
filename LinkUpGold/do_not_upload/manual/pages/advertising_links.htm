<p><span class="text13a_bold">Advertising/sponsored links</span><br /><br />Registered 
users can order extra features for their links and pay for it. We call such 
links as Advertising or Sponsored links. Free links use templates link_a.txt 
and link_details.html, while advertising links use templates <span class="template">link_advertising.txt</span> 
and<span class="template"> link_details_advertising.html</span>. It means that you can mark advertising links 
by some way (bigger font, another color etc.). Styles used in these paid links 
are highlighted by default.</p>
<p>Advertising links are always at the top of categories 
and search results. You also can configure the system so advertising links can 
have advantages like more pictures, the option to submit them to more categories, 
etc.</p>
<p>There is not an extra form to create an advertising link. Users can create 
normal free links and then upgrade them to advertising links. The process of 
free link submission is described <a href="link_submit.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Users who want to see their links can use the link &quot;Your links &amp; invoices&quot; 
in the menu in users area. URL of the page 
is <SPAN 
class=fakelink>link_edit.php?action=links_list</SPAN>. This page uses template 
<span class="template">links_for_owner_list.html</span>.&nbsp;The first table 
on this page shows all existing links of the user. Existing links are displayed by the 
variable #%links%#, each line in this list is based on template <span class="template">links_for_owner_list_link.txt</span>.

<p>This page offers two main options:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Simple option - User orders a limited number of days, pays by a credit 
    card and the link becomes immediately sponsored or it adds new days to it 
    if the link was sponsored before. The order process is described <a href="payment_system.htm">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Flexible options - These options use funds (money) prepaid before. These 
    funds are on users account and can be used for advertising links and AdLinks. 
    Your users can use packages you created in Administration =&gt; Packages 
    to add new funds to their accounts. The order process is described <a href="payment_system.htm">here</a>. 
    These flexible options allow users to order clicks, impressions or days, 
    the prices for all these are editable in Configuration. If they want to 
    order clicks, they can choose between fixed prices (in this case prices 
    for all clicks are the same) or dynamic prices (in this case you set a range 
    of prices and users can choose a price for each click&nbsp;inside this range, 
    more expensive links are higher).<br>These flexible options also contain 
    the option to cancel unused clicks, impressions and days. If this is used, 
    the funds are refunded to users main account and can be used for another 
    options or for another link.</li>
