<p><span class="text13a_bold">Your own PHP code</span></p>
<p>You can enter your own PHP commands in html templates. If you want to use 
this feature, allow it in Configuration. Use the tag &lt;? to open php code 
and ?&gt; to close php code. If you want the php code to print something on 
pages, don't use echo() command but put your output to variable $line. For example 
if you want to print the text &quot;This is my text&quot;, use this command:</p>
<p>$line .= 'This is my text';</p>
<p>Not all php code will work by this way because there may be a conflict between 
your code and the code in our scripts, for example there can be the same names 
of functions or so.<br /><br /></p>
