<p><span class="text13a_bold">Queue</span><br /><br />There are multiple places 
where can be queued items. These are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Queue link under &quot;Links&quot;. There are links submitted&nbsp;that 
    need to be approved or rejected. There are also queued comments for links.</li>
    <li>Queue link under &quot;Articles&quot;. There are articles&nbsp;submitted&nbsp;that 
    need to be approved or rejected. There are also queued comments for articles.</li>
    <li>Search under AdLinks. If there are some AdLinks in the queue, it shows 
    this info and a link to review them over the search form.</li>
    <li>Orders. If there are some orders&nbsp;in the queue, it shows this info 
    and a link to review them over the search for orders&nbsp;form.</li>
    <li>Search under Users. If there are some users&nbsp;in the queue, it shows 
    this info and a link to review them over the search form.</li>
</ul>
<p>Owners 
 of rejected links, articles, AdLinks&nbsp;and rejected users
will be informed by email only if you select an  email 
to send. Templates for rejection emails may be found in directory styles/_common/email_templates, 
their names look like <span class="template">reject_link_SOMEWORD.txt</span>,<span class="template"> reject_article_SOMEWORD.txt</span>, 
<span class="template">reject_user_SOMEWORD.txt</span>, <span class="template">reject_adlink_SOMEWORD.txt</span>. 
You can create any number of new templates, these will be available in the queue 
form if you use the file names as described. <br />Note: As 
all email templates, also these must have the first line containing word Subject:. 
Next to the word will be subject for the emails which should the script send. 
Below the line must be one blank line and then should be a text of the email.<br /><br /></p>
