<p>There are two scripts in 
folder do_not_upload/tools. These are not needed if all goes 
properly but may be useful if something goes wrong. If you need to use one of 
them, upload it&nbsp;into your administration directory and open it by your browser.<br /><br /><u>Create_admin.php</u><br />Run 
it if you have forgot username and/or password to enter your Administration area. It 
creates a new administrator with all available rights.<br /><br /><u>Repair_tables.php</u><br />Run 
it if some tables which uses Link Up Gold have been damaged due a server 
error. This script tries to fix it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
