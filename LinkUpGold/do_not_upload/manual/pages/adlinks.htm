<p><span class="text13a_bold">AdLinks</span><br /><br />AdLinks are small ads 
with a few lines of text that are in the right column of&nbsp;categories of 
links and search results. There can be 1-10 text lines, these are automatically 
formatted by using template <span class="template">adlink_template.txt </span>(your users enter plain text only) 
or 
<span class="template">adlink_template_html.txt</span> (if you allow users to 
enter plain HTML AdLinks).&nbsp;All these 
AdLinks are placed to template <span class="template">adlinks.txt</span>.</p>
<p>Users don't pay for impressions but only for clicks. They can choose the 
price they want to pay for each click, more expensive links are higher. You 
need to set the minimum and maximum allowed price - there are fields for it 
in Configuration.</p>
<p>The option to create a new AdLink is in the menu inside users area. The URL 
is <span class="fakelink">adlinks.php?action=adlink_create</span>. It uses template <span class="template">adlink_create.html</span>, 
these variables can be used:</p>
