<p><span class="text13a_bold">Integrated poll - poll.php</span><br /><br />This 
script is used to create a simple poll which is integrated in the directory. 
By default it's in template _in1.txt but you can place the code to any other 
template. The code to display the poll looks like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;a name=&quot;poll&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br>&lt;span name=&quot;poll_results&quot; id=&quot;poll_results&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<br>&lt;span name=&quot;poll_show&quot; id=&quot;poll_show&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; language=&quot;javascript&quot; src=&quot;#%site_url%#/poll.php?n=POLL_NUMBER&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<p>The 
poll may be created or modified in the Administration. You can create an unlimited 
number of polls, also unlimited number of polls may be active at the same time. Each poll may have maximum of 5 answers. Visitor who votes in your poll 
gets a cookie which is active for 30 days. If the same visitor try to vote in 
these 30 days in the same poll again, the click will be not counted.<br /><br />To show 
the table with a poll are used templates <span class="template">poll.txt</span> and <span class="template"> 
poll_results.txt</span>.</p>
